# Publishing to MonoPlay Store

Once your game is ready, you can publish it directly to the MonoPlay store from Forge. The publishing process handles platform builds, security scanning, code signing, and store listing creation — all in one streamlined workflow.

## Before You Publish

### 1. Test Thoroughly

Make sure your game is stable and playable:
- **No game-breaking bugs** — Players should be able to complete the experience
- **Performance** — Test on different hardware (if possible) to ensure smooth gameplay
- **Controls** — Verify all inputs work as expected
- **UI** — Check that menus, buttons, and text are readable and functional
- **Audio** — Ensure sound effects and music play correctly

### 2. Replace Placeholder Assets

Forge generates code but uses placeholder graphics and sounds. Before publishing:
- Create or commission final art (sprites, 3D models, textures)
- Add proper sound effects and music
- Design UI elements (buttons, icons, fonts)
- Write final text (menus, dialogue, tutorials)

You can push updated assets to GitHub and sync them to Forge, or publish with placeholders and update later.

### 3. Prepare Marketing Materials

You'll need these for your store listing:
- **Game title** — Clear, memorable name
- **Short description** — 1-2 sentences explaining the game (max 160 characters)
- **Full description** — Detailed overview, features, and gameplay (max 2000 characters)
- **Screenshots** — At least 3 screenshots showing gameplay (1920x1080 recommended)
- **Cover art** — Primary store image (1200x800 pixels)
- **Trailer** (optional) — Gameplay video (YouTube or direct upload, max 2 minutes)

### 4. Choose Your Pricing

Decide if your game will be:
- **Free** — No cost to download
- **Paid** — One-time purchase ($0.99 - $59.99)
- **Free with IAP** — Free to download with in-app purchases or DLC

MonoPlay takes a **15% platform fee** on all sales. You receive 85% of revenue after payment processing fees.

## Publishing Workflow

### Step 1: Initiate Publishing

From your Forge project:

1. Click the **"Publish"** button in the top toolbar
2. Review the pre-publish checklist
3. Click **"Continue to Publishing"**

### Step 2: Security Scan

Forge automatically runs security checks on your game:

- **Dependency audit** — Checks for known vulnerabilities in crates
- **Code analysis** — Scans for common security issues (buffer overflows, unsafe code)
- **Asset verification** — Ensures assets don't contain malware or inappropriate content
- **Privacy compliance** — Verifies no unauthorized data collection

This takes 2-5 minutes depending on project size.

If issues are found, you'll see a report with:
- **Critical** — Must be fixed before publishing
- **Warnings** — Recommended fixes (won't block publishing)
- **Info** — Best practice suggestions

Fix critical issues and re-run the scan.

### Step 3: Platform Builds

Once security passes, Forge compiles your game for desktop platforms:

- **Windows** (x64) — `.exe` installer and portable `.zip`
- **macOS** (Universal) — `.dmg` installer and `.app` bundle
- **Linux** (x64) — `.AppImage` and `.tar.gz`

This process takes 5-10 minutes as each platform is built and tested.

You can preview each build by clicking **"Download Test Build"** before finalizing.

### Step 4: Code Signing

For Windows and macOS, Forge code-signs your game with MonoPlay's developer certificate. This:
- Prevents "Unknown Publisher" warnings on Windows
- Allows installation on macOS without Gatekeeper warnings
- Increases player trust and download rates

**Note:** If you have your own code signing certificate, you can provide it in the advanced settings.

### Step 5: Store Listing

Fill out your store page:

#### Basic Information
- **Game Title** — Public-facing name (can differ from project name)
- **Subtitle** — One-line hook (e.g., "A fast-paced platformer with a twist")
- **Developer Name** — Your name or studio name

#### Description
- **Short Description** — Appears in search results and cards (max 160 chars)
- **Full Description** — Main store page description (supports Markdown)

Example:
```markdown

## Common Questions

### Can I publish games made outside of Forge?

Not through the Forge publishing workflow. However, the main MonoPlay developer portal accepts any game built with Bevy or other engines. Forge publishing is exclusively for Forge-created games.

### What if my game doesn't pass security review?

You'll receive a detailed report. Fix the issues in Forge (or locally, then sync), and resubmit. There's no penalty for failed reviews.

### Can I publish the same game on Steam, Itch.io, etc.?

Yes. You retain full rights to your game. MonoPlay's agreement is non-exclusive. However, you can't sell Steam keys in the MonoPlay store or vice versa.

### Do I need a business license or tax ID?

Not required, but recommended if you expect significant revenue. MonoPlay reports payments to tax authorities in your country.

### Can I unpublish my game later?

Yes. You can delist your game at any time, making it unavailable for new purchases. Existing owners retain access.

### What happens if my game violates policies after launch?

MonoPlay reserves the right to remove games that violate terms of service. You'll be notified and given a chance to fix issues before removal.
