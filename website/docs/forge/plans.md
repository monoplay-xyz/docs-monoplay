## Free Plan

**Perfect for: Learning, prototyping, exploring what's possible**

### What's Included

- **5 generations per month** — Enough to create a simple game or prototype
- **All templates and SDKs** — Full access to MonoPlay Forge's capabilities
- **Browser preview** — Test your game instantly in the browser
- **Source code download** — Download and study generated Rust/Bevy code
- **GitHub integration** — Push your code to a repository

### Limitations

- **No publishing** — Can't publish to MonoPlay store (you can still compile locally and distribute elsewhere)
- **Non-commercial license** — For personal learning and non-commercial projects only
- **Standard build priority** — No expedited compilation

### Best For

- **Students** learning game development
- **Hobbyists** exploring Forge's capabilities
- **Educators** teaching game design concepts
- **Developers** evaluating Forge before committing

### Example Use Case

You're curious about game development but not ready to invest. You use your 5 generations to:
1. Create initial platformer (1 gen)
2. Add double jump (1 gen)
3. Add enemies (1 gen)
4. Add collectibles (1 gen)
5. Polish UI (1 gen)

You now have a playable game you can download and learn from. Next month, you get 5 more generations.

## Creator Plan

**Perfect for: Indie developers, solo creators, small projects**

### What's Included

Everything in Free, plus:

- **100 generations per month** — Enough for 2-3 complete games or ongoing updates
- **Store publishing** — Publish to MonoPlay store with one click
- **Platform builds** — Automatic Windows, macOS, and Linux installers
- **Code signing** — Signed binaries prevent security warnings
- **Commercial license** — Sell your games and keep 85% of revenue
- **Email support** — Response within 48 hours

### Cost Breakdown

At $20/month, each generation costs $0.20. Compared to:
- Hiring a developer: $50-150/hour
- Game engine licenses: $0-1,800/year
- Asset packs and tools: $10-100 each

One published game can recoup the monthly cost with just 2-3 sales at $10.

### Best For

- **Indie developers** building and publishing games
- **Designers** who want to prototype rapidly
- **Game jam participants** creating multiple games per month
- **Content creators** making games for YouTube/Twitch

### Example Use Case

You're an indie developer working on a puzzle game. You spend your 100 generations across 4 weeks:

**Week 1:** Build core mechanics (20 gens)
**Week 2:** Add levels and polish (25 gens)
**Week 3:** Playtest and iterate based on feedback (30 gens)
**Week 4:** Final touches and publish (15 gens)
**Reserve:** 10 gens for post-launch bug fixes

You publish the game at $4.99. After platform fees and MonoPlay's 15% cut, you earn ~$4.00 per sale. Break even at 5 sales.

## Studio Plan

**Perfect for: Teams, professional studios, ongoing live games**

### What's Included

Everything in Creator, plus:

- **Unlimited generations** — No monthly cap, iterate as much as needed
- **Priority builds** — 2x faster compilation (30s avg vs 60s)
- **Team collaboration** — Up to 5 seats included (additional seats $10/month each)
- **Priority support** — 24-hour guaranteed response, dedicated Discord channel
- **Beta templates** — Early access to new templates before public release
- **Experimental SDKs** — Cutting-edge features (VR, advanced multiplayer, etc.)
- **Custom SDK modules** — Request and prioritize features you need
- **Advanced analytics** — Player heatmaps, session recordings, funnel analysis
- **Dedicated account manager** — For studios shipping multiple titles

### Cost Breakdown

At $50/month for a team of 5:
- **$10/person/month** — Cheaper than most development tools
- **Unlimited iterations** — No need to ration generations
- **Faster time-to-market** — Priority builds save hours per project

For a studio shipping 2-3 games per quarter, this is a minimal expense compared to salaries and tools.

### Best For

- **Small studios** (2-10 people) working on multiple projects
- **Consultancies** building games for clients
- **Educators** teaching classes (1 Studio account + student seats)
- **Live service games** requiring frequent updates

### Example Use Case

Your 3-person studio is building a multiplayer arena shooter. You use Studio features:

- **Unlimited gens:** Iterate daily based on playtester feedback (200+ gens/month)
- **Team seats:** All 3 devs have access, can iterate in parallel
- **Priority builds:** Faster compile times mean more iterations per day
- **Advanced analytics:** Track where players die most, balance weapon usage
- **Priority support:** Quick answers when you hit issues

You ship the game in 8 weeks (vs. 12+ weeks without Forge), publish on MonoPlay, then iterate weekly based on player data.

## Generation Usage Explained

### What Counts as a Generation?

**Each of these uses 1 generation:**
- Initial game creation from template
- Iteration prompt (adding features, fixing bugs, tweaking values)
- Regeneration after error or failed compile

**These do NOT count as generations:**
- Viewing source code
- Downloading project files
- Pushing to GitHub
- Publishing to store
- Updating store listing

### How to Maximize Your Generations

#### On Free Plan (5/month)

**Plan your game in advance:**
- Sketch mechanics and features on paper
- Write detailed prompts to get more done per generation
- Test thoroughly in preview before iterating

**Example efficient workflow:**
```
Gen 1: "Create a platformer with jump, move, and basic platforms.
        Add 3 levels with increasing difficulty."
Gen 2: "Add collectible coins and enemy spikes. Show score and lives."
Gen 3: "Polish: Add sound effects, particle effects on coin collect,
        and a victory screen."
Gen 4: Fix any bugs found during playtesting.
Gen 5: Reserve for final polish or emergency fix.
```

#### On Creator Plan (100/month)

**Iterate freely but stay organized:**
- 1-2 generations per feature is typical
- Reserve 20-30 gens for bug fixes and polish
- Budget 70 gens for new features and content

**Example monthly budget:**
- Game 1: 40 gens (build + publish)
- Game 2: 35 gens (early development)
- Maintenance: 15 gens (updates to existing games)
- Buffer: 10 gens (unexpected needs)

#### On Studio Plan (Unlimited)

**No need to ration — experiment freely:**
- Try multiple approaches to the same feature
- A/B test different mechanics
- Iterate daily or hourly based on playtests
- Don't worry about "wasting" generations

### Generation Rollover

**Free Plan:** Unused generations expire at month end (no rollover)
**Creator Plan:** Up to 20 generations roll over to next month (max 120 total)
**Studio Plan:** Unlimited, no rollover needed

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What happens if I hit my generation limit?

**Free Plan:** Wait until next month, or upgrade to Creator/Studio
**Creator Plan:** Wait until next month, or upgrade to Studio for unlimited

You can always download your existing projects and continue development locally (with manual compilation).

### Can I buy extra generations?

Not on Free plan. Creator plan can purchase add-on packs:
- 25 generations: $10
- 50 generations: $18
- 100 generations: $30

Add-ons expire at month end (no rollover).

### Does publishing use generations?

No. Publishing, updating games, and store management don't consume generations. Only code generation and iteration use your quota.

### If I cancel, do I lose my games?

No. Published games remain on the store. Downloaded source code is yours forever. GitHub repositories are unaffected. You just can't create new games or iterations.

### Can multiple people share one Creator account?

Technically possible, but against terms of service. Use Studio plan for teams — it's designed for collaboration with proper seat management.

### Do I get charged for team seats that aren't used?

No. You're only charged for active seats. Invite someone, they count as a seat. Remove them, you're not charged next cycle.

### What if I need more than 5 Studio seats?

Additional seats are $10/month each. Add unlimited seats from your account dashboard.

### Can I switch between monthly and annual billing?

Yes, but you can't get a refund on unused monthly time. Annual switch takes effect at next billing cycle.
