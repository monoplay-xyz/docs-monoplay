# MonoPlay Forge

MonoPlay Forge is an AI-powered game builder that transforms natural language descriptions into fully playable games. Describe your game idea in plain English, and Forge generates production-ready code built on the Bevy game engine.

## What is Forge?

Forge is a complete game development environment that combines artificial intelligence with the MonoPlay SDK to help you create games without writing code manually. Instead of spending weeks setting up systems and boilerplate, you focus on your creative vision while Forge handles the technical implementation.

Every game generated by Forge is:
- Built on **Bevy 0.18**, a modern data-driven game engine written in Rust
- Powered by **MonoPlay SDKs** for physics, UI, audio, multiplayer, and blockchain features
- **Fully editable** — you own the source code and can modify it freely
- **Ready to publish** — one-click deployment to the MonoPlay store

## How It Works

Forge follows a simple workflow from idea to published game:

### 1. Prompt
Describe your game in natural language. Be as detailed or high-level as you want:
- "A 2D platformer where you play as a robot collecting batteries"
- "Top-down zombie survival with crafting and base building"
- "Puzzle game with physics-based block stacking mechanics"

### 2. Generate
The AI analyzes your prompt and generates a complete Bevy project with:
- Game logic and systems
- Entity component architecture
- UI layouts and menus
- Asset loading and configuration
- Input handling
- Game state management

### 3. Preview
Watch your game compile in real-time and play it instantly in your browser. No installation required.

### 4. Iterate
Refine your game through conversation:
- "Add a double jump mechanic"
- "Make enemies spawn faster after level 5"
- "Add a health bar in the top-left corner"

Each iteration builds on the previous version, preserving your game's structure while adding new features.

### 5. Publish
Push your game to GitHub with full commit history, then publish to the MonoPlay store with one click. Set your price, add screenshots, and reach players on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Who Is Forge For?

### Game Designers
Turn your ideas into playable prototypes in minutes instead of weeks. Test game mechanics and iterate rapidly without coding.

### Indie Developers
Bootstrap your projects with AI-generated systems and focus your time on unique gameplay, art, and polish.

### Educators
Teach game design concepts with instant feedback. Students see how their ideas translate into working systems.

### Hobbyists
Build the games you've always wanted to make without years of programming experience.

## What Can You Make?

Forge excels at creating a wide variety of game genres:

**2D Games**
- Platformers with precise physics and responsive controls
- Puzzle games with custom rule systems
- Top-down adventures and RPGs
- Arcade-style action games

**3D Games**
- First-person and third-person experiences
- Survival games with resource management
- Arena combat and PvP games
- Exploration and walking simulators

**Multiplayer Games**
- Real-time PvP arenas
- Co-op survival experiences
- Turn-based strategy games
- Persistent world games

**Blockchain-Enabled Games**
- NFT-based collectibles and items
- On-chain achievements and leaderboards
- Token-gated content and rewards
- Play-to-earn mechanics

## Technical Foundation

Under the hood, Forge generates Rust code using the Bevy Entity Component System (ECS) architecture. This means your games are:

- **Fast** — Compiled to native code with zero-cost abstractions
- **Reliable** — Rust's type system prevents entire classes of bugs
- **Portable** — Deploy to Windows, macOS, Linux, and WebAssembly
- **Scalable** — ECS architecture handles complex games efficiently

Every generated game uses the MonoPlay SDK, giving you access to eight specialized crates:

- **core** — Entity management, resources, and game loop
- **input** — Keyboard, mouse, gamepad, and touch input
- **physics** — 2D/3D collision detection and rigid body dynamics
- **ui** — Menus, HUD elements, and interactive components
- **audio** — Sound effects, music, and spatial audio
- **multiplayer** — Client-server networking and state synchronization
- **mono** — Blockchain integration (wallets, NFTs, tokens)
- **world** — Procedural generation and level management

## Limitations

While Forge is powerful, there are some things it doesn't handle automatically:

- **Custom pixel art or 3D models** — Forge uses placeholder assets. You'll need to provide or create final art.
- **Complex shaders and visual effects** — Advanced rendering techniques require manual implementation.
- **Platform-specific optimizations** — Console ports and mobile optimization need additional work.
- **Narrative content** — Dialogue, story branches, and quest systems require manual scripting.

These limitations don't prevent you from building complete games — they just mean some aspects require traditional development after the initial AI generation.
