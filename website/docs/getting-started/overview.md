# What is MonoPlay?

MonoPlay is a decentralized game distribution platform that leverages blockchain technology to create a fairer, more transparent ecosystem for players, developers, and infrastructure providers.

Unlike traditional platforms like Steam or Epic Games Store, MonoPlay uses on-chain licensing, decentralized storage, and cryptocurrency payments to eliminate platform lock-in, reduce costs, and give users true ownership of their games.

## The Three Products

### MonoPlay Platform

The **MonoPlay Platform** is the player-facing storefront and launcher. It's where users discover, purchase, and play games.

**Key Features:**
- Browse and search thousands of games across all genres
- Purchase games with LYTH cryptocurrency
- Download and manage your library via the desktop launcher
- On-chain license verification (play offline, no DRM)
- Community reviews and ratings
- Wishlist tracking and price alerts

**Who It's For:**
- **Gamers** who want to own their games without DRM restrictions

## Key Benefits

### True Ownership

When you purchase a game on MonoPlay, you receive an on-chain license record stored in the Monolythium blockchain. This license is **yours forever** — no company can revoke it, no platform shutdown can delete it.

Unlike traditional platforms where you're "licensing" games subject to Terms of Service changes, MonoPlay licenses are immutable smart contract records.

### No DRM, No Restrictions

Traditional DRM systems require constant online check-ins and can break games when servers shut down. MonoPlay uses **cached license tokens** that work offline indefinitely.

Play your games anytime, anywhere, without internet access.

### Lower Costs, Higher Revenue Share

Decentralized distribution via GRID eliminates expensive CDN costs. This savings gets passed on:
- **Players** pay lower prices
- **Developers** keep a higher revenue share (70-85% vs. 50-70% on traditional platforms)
- **Node operators** earn rewards for contributing infrastructure

### Privacy & Decentralization

MonoPlay doesn't collect personal data. Authentication is wallet-based — no email, no password, no personal information required.

Games are distributed peer-to-peer, making censorship difficult and ensuring availability even during outages.

## Technology Stack

MonoPlay is built on:
- **Monolythium Blockchain**: EVM-compatible chain with fast finality and low fees
- **Bevy Engine**: Modern Rust game engine with ECS architecture
- **BitTorrent Protocol**: Proven peer-to-peer distribution technology
- **IPFS/Torrent Hybrid**: Redundant storage and retrieval
- **Smart Contracts**: On-chain licensing, payments, and revenue distribution

## Open Source & Community

Core MonoPlay infrastructure is **open source** and community-audited:
- Platform smart contracts
- GRID node software
- Bevy SDKs and modules
- API documentation

This transparency ensures security, enables third-party integrations, and prevents platform lock-in.
