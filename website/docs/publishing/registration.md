# Publisher Registration

Before submitting games to MonoPlay, you must register as a verified publisher. This process ensures platform integrity and protects players.

## Prerequisites

You'll need:

- A Monolythium-compatible wallet (MetaMask, Rabby, or WalletConnect)
- At least 500 LYTH for the registration deposit
- Legal business information (or personal details for indie developers)
- Government-issued ID for verification
- A valid email address

## Registration Steps

### 1. Connect Your Wallet

Navigate to the [Developer Console](https://console.monoplay.xyz) and click "Register as Publisher".

- Click "Connect Wallet"
- Select your wallet provider
- Approve the connection request
- Sign the authentication message (EIP-191)

Your wallet address becomes your permanent publisher ID.

### 2. Submit Legal Information

Provide accurate information about your studio or yourself:

**For Studios/Companies:**
- Legal business name
- Business registration number
- Country of incorporation
- Business address
- Tax identification number
- Primary contact name and email

**For Individual Developers:**
- Full legal name
- Country of residence
- Residential address (used for verification only, not public)
- Email address
- Phone number

All information is encrypted and stored securely. Only your chosen display name appears publicly.

### 3. Choose Your Display Name

Select how your studio appears to players:

- 3-50 characters
- Letters, numbers, spaces, hyphens only
- Must be unique across MonoPlay
- Can be changed once every 90 days

Example: "Pixel Storm Studios", "IndieGameDev", "Team Nebula"

### 4. Upload Verification Documents

Identity verification prevents fraud and abuse:

**Required Documents:**
- Government-issued photo ID (passport, driver's license, or national ID)
- Proof of address (utility bill, bank statement, dated within 90 days)
- Business registration document (companies only)

**Supported Formats:**
- PDF, PNG, JPG
- Maximum 5MB per file
- Clear, readable scans or photos

Documents are reviewed by our verification team and deleted after approval.

### 5. Pay Registration Deposit

The 500 LYTH deposit is held in the SubmissionFees contract:

- Protects against fraudulent publishers
- Returned if your application is rejected
- Locked while you have active games on the platform
- Returned within 7 days after platform exit (if no violations)

**To pay:**
1. Review the deposit amount (500 LYTH + network fees)
2. Click "Pay Deposit"
3. Approve the transaction in your wallet
4. Wait for blockchain confirmation

The transaction typically confirms in 3-6 seconds on Monolythium.

### 6. Await Verification

After submission, our team reviews your application:

**Review Process:**
- Identity verification (automated + manual review)
- Legal information validation
- Sanctions and watchlist screening
- Publisher history check (if applicable)

**Timeline:**
- Most applications: 24-48 hours
- Complex cases: up to 5 business days
- You'll receive email updates at each stage

**Possible Outcomes:**
- **Approved**: Full access to Developer Console, ready to submit games
- **Pending**: Additional information requested via email
- **Rejected**: Deposit refunded automatically, reason provided

## After Approval

Once verified, you can:

- Submit games for review
- Access analytics dashboard
- Manage game listings
- Configure pricing and licensing
- View revenue reports

## Publisher Profile

Your public profile is automatically created:

- Display name
- Publisher bio (optional, can be added later)
- Publisher logo (optional, recommended 512x512 PNG)
- Website link (optional)
- Social media links (optional)

Configure your profile in the Developer Console under "Settings" > "Publisher Profile".

## Security Best Practices

Protect your publisher account:

- **Hardware wallet recommended** for high-value accounts
- **Multi-signature wallet** for team-managed studios
- **Never share your seed phrase** with anyone
- **Use a dedicated wallet** for MonoPlay publishing (separate from personal funds)
- **Enable 2FA** on your email account

Your wallet controls all publisher actions, including game submissions and revenue withdrawals.

## Common Issues

### Verification Delays

If your application exceeds the stated timeline:

- Check your spam folder for verification emails
- Ensure uploaded documents are clear and readable
- Contact support: publisher-verification@monoplay.xyz

### Rejected Applications

Common rejection reasons:

- Unclear or expired ID documents
- Mismatched information between ID and registration form
- Previous platform violations
- Sanctioned entities or regions

You can reapply after addressing the rejection reason. Deposits are refunded automatically.

### Wallet Connection Issues

If you can't connect your wallet:

- Ensure you're on the Monolythium network
- Clear browser cache and try again
- Try a different wallet or browser
- Check the [Developer FAQ](../reference/faq.md)
