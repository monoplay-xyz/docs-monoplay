# Welcome to MonoPlay

MonoPlay is a decentralized game distribution platform built on the Monolythium blockchain. We're reimagining how games are built, distributed, and played — putting ownership and rewards back in the hands of players, developers, and the community.

## The MonoPlay Ecosystem

MonoPlay consists of three interconnected products:

### 🎮 MonoPlay Platform

The complete game store and launcher experience. Browse, purchase, and play games with blockchain-powered licensing and wallet-based authentication. No accounts to manage, no DRM hassles — just games.

- **Storefront**: Discover games across all genres
- **Desktop Launcher**: Manage your library and downloads
- **On-Chain Licensing**: Provably own your games forever
- **LYTH Payments**: Fast, low-cost transactions

### 🛠️ MonoPlay Forge

AI-powered game development tools built on the Bevy engine. Create 2D and 3D games using natural language prompts, visual editors, and pre-built SDKs. No coding required to get started, full code access when you need it.

- **AI Game Builder**: Describe your game, get a playable prototype
- **Bevy Engine Integration**: Modern Rust-based game engine
- **SDK Library**: Physics, networking, UI, audio modules
- **One-Click Publishing**: Deploy directly to the Platform

### 🌐 MonoPlay GRID

A decentralized content delivery network (CDN) powered by community-run nodes. Games are distributed via torrent protocol, ensuring fast downloads and censorship resistance. Run a GRID node and earn LYTH rewards for seeding games.

- **Torrent Distribution**: Faster downloads, lower infrastructure costs
- **Seeder Rewards**: Earn LYTH for contributing bandwidth
- **Redundancy**: Games stay available even if the platform goes offline
- **Low Latency**: Download from nearby nodes
